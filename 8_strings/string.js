Scenario 4: Extracting Date Information
You have a string with a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD, like "2025-02-08". 
You need to extract the year, month, and day from this string.

Question: How would you extract just the month (e.g., "02") from the date string?

Scenario 5: Search and Replace in Text
You are building a content moderation system for a blog or forum 
where certain offensive words need to be replaced with something more appropriate. 
For instance, you want to replace the word "badword" with "****".

Question: How would you replace a specific offensive word in a string with a safer word or asterisks?

/*
Scenario 6: Generating a URL Slug
You are building a blog or website where titles are used to generate URL slugs. 
The title might have spaces, capital letters, and special characters, 
but you need to convert it to a lowercase string with _ instead of spaces 
(e.g., "This is a title!" becomes "this_is_a_title").

Question: How would you generate a clean URL-friendly version of a title string?
